This is the best YA book I’ve read in a while. I mean, I read a few others that were pretty good, and I’ll get to talking abut them, but this was just far and away one of the best ones. It’s not really the kind of book I would re-read, but it was one of those books that just really got it. What it’s like to be a teenager, I mean.

It’s terrible and frustrating, and you feel like people are always thinking about you badly, and sometimes you’re right, but most of the time, they’re just thinking abut themselves. I can’t say a lot about this book without giving away spoilers, but here are some things that are true:

The prose is excellent. Each character is distinct, and it feels like your best friend is confiding in you, the whole time. The crises are realistic; this is not a book about a town waiting with bated breath to hear of their prom queen. This book is about surviving and falling in love even when you don’t totally mean to. It’s about Darcy loving Lizzie before he even knew he liked her, and not knowing what to do about it. It’s about the fact that some adults can be trusted and some can’t, and you don’t always know who belongs in what camp.

This book has a ton of music references, comic books, and some sort of fighting that I have already forgotten the name of. But really, this book is not about fighting, or heroes, or even music – it’s about how all of these things bring two wildly different people together. It’s a book abut love, fear, and escape, and it is simply excellent.
